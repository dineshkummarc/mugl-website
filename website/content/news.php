	If you would like to present at a future MUGL, please get in
	touch.  This group should be about the members and what they're
	interested in and doing.  It should not be a one-way channel
	for information coming from MarkLogic.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
	If you've been involved with an interesting project or
	want to talk about something you have some expertise in that you think
	would be of interest to the membership, tell us about it.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
	You don't have to fill up an hour or even do a formal presentation.
	Get in touch and we'll figure out a way to share the love.
