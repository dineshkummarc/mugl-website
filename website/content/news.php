	Mark your calendars: Tuesday, May 22, 2012.

	<p class="homepagetext">
    In May we are very honored to have
	<a href="http://www.jenitennison.com/" target="speaker">Dr. Jeni Tennison</a>
    as our featured guest.  While in Prague I was able to convince Dr. Tennison
    (who gave the keynote at <a href="http://www.xmlprague.cz">XML Prague 2012</a>)
    to speak to the MUGL in May.  Jeni doesn't do many events like this so
    we're doubly lucky that she's agreed visit us.
    </p>

	<p class="homepagetext">
    Dr. Tennison's interests are far ranging and tend toward the academic,
    but she is perhaps best known for writing three XSLT books:
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590593243" title="Beginning XSLT 2.0" alt="Beginning XSLT 2.0" target="book"><i>Beginning XSLT 2.0</i></a>,
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861005946" title="Beginning XSLT" alt="Beginning XSLT" target="book"><i>Beginning XSLT</i></a> and
        <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764547763" title="XSLT and XPath On The Edge" alt="XSLT and XPath On The Edge" target="book"><i>XSLT and XPath On The Edge</i></a>.
    </p>

    <p class="homepagetext">
        Topic of her talk: "I can talk about
        <a href="http://legislation.gov.uk/" target="misc">legislation.gov.uk</a> and how we're using
        MarkLogic within it, and *not* using ML for some of the new features that we're supporting."

    This will be a great meeting, you won't want to miss it.  We also
    have a new venue, which should be an improvement over
    the classrooms and conference rooms we've had so far.  This one
    will be in the upstairs function room at the
    <a href="http://www.theodore-bullfrog.co.uk/" target="pub" title="Theodore BullFrog" alt="Theodore BullFrog">Theodore BullFrog Pub</a>
    a few steps from Charing Cross.  Visit the MeetUp link on the right
    sidebar for directions and to signup.  Free food and a private, open bar.

	If you would like to present at a future MUGL, please get in
	touch.  This group should be about the members and what they're
	interested in and doing.  It should not be a one-way channel
	for information coming from MarkLogic.

	<p class="homepagetext">
	If you've been involved with an interesting project or
	want to talk about something you have some expertise in that you think
	would be of interest to the membership, tell us about it.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
	You don't have to fill up an hour or even do a formal presentation.
	Get in touch and we'll figure out a way to share the love.
