	<h2>April 14, 2011: Inaugural MUGL Meeting</h2>

	<p class="homepagetext">
		The very first meeting of the MUGL took place 
		on July 14, 2011 at the Skills Matter Exchange.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		By all accounts it was a great success.  We had
		attendance of about 20 people, from a variety of
		companies around London that are using MarkLogic
		in many different ways.  Not bad considering we did
		very little promotion.  We even had a couple of
		senior MarkLogic people from The States drop by
		who were in London for other reasons.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		One of our members, Martin Dransfield, took some
		photos of the event.  Once I get the chance, I will
		upload them here and on the MeetUp site.

		My <a href="http://prezi.com/r-mzgxuw6fim/mugl/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>,
		which gave a little background
		on the early days of MarkLogic,
		was apparently quite a hit.  It's Flash-based and
		done with a tool called Prezi.  You can play it
		in your very own browser from the Prezi site,
		just click the link above.

	<p class="homepagetext">
		Please spread the word about the MUGL to your
		friends and associates.  And don't forget to 
		<a href="http://www.meetup.com/muglondon/" target="foo">sign up</a>
		if you plan to attend the next meeting.
