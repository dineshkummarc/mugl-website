    <p class="homepagetext">
        On Thursday, November 19, 2011 we had a very interesting presentation
        by <a href="http://webcomposite.com/" target="kay">James Fuller</a>
        of MarkLogic.  Jim is an XQuery innovator and spoke about
        being more productive with
        <i>XQuery - The GSD Language</i>.  If you've never heard of the MarkLogic
        term "GSD", it's like Getting Things Done, but a bit ruder.

        The slides for Jim's presentation from the GoTo Conference are available on

	<div class="floatpicture"><img src="images/225px-Michael_kay_nov_2008.jpg" width="110" height="128"/></div>

	<p class="homepagetext">
	On Wednesday, October 19, 2011 we had the pleasure of hosting
	<a href="http://saxonica.com/contact/contact.xml" target="kay">Dr. Michael Kay</a>,
	the father of <a href="http://saxonica.com" target="kay">Saxon</a>
	and influential member of various and sundry XML-related W3C standards committees.
	</p>

	<p class="homepagetext">
	Dr. Kay gave us a very interesting introduction to his Saxon-in-the-browser
	XSLT 2.0 processor that's implemented with JavaScript and GWT.  If you missed
	this talk you've missed one of the great innovators of the XML world.

	<h2>September 15, 2011: Norm Walsh, REST Easy With MarkLogic</h2>
	<div class="floatpicture"><img src="images/norm.gif"/></div>

	<p class="homepagetext">
	On September 15, 2011.
	<a href="http://norman.walsh.name/" target="norm">Norm Walsh</a>,
	MarkLogic Lead Engineer, XML/XQuery/DocBook/XProc maven and well known
	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8SNp_cQfrA" target="youtube">tall guy</a> was
	our guest at the September MUGL meeting.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
	Norm stopped off on his way to XML Summer School in Oxford to
	give us a very interesting talk about doing REST natively on
	MarkLogic.  This was "Norm's half" of a talk that Norm and I
	presented jointly at the MarkLogic User Conference in
	San Francisco in May, 2011.

	<p class="homepagetext">
		My <a href="http://prezi.com/jlkpxfja7dda/mugl-september-2011-norm-walsh/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>
		for this presentation has the usual overview of MarkLogic
		and some amusing photos of Norman Walsh(es).

	<h2>August 17, 2011: Stephen Buxton, A Sneak Peak at MarkLogic 5.0</h2>

	<p class="homepagetext">
		Stephen Buxton, Director of Product Management at MarkLogic
		flew in from California and gave us a very well received talk
		about some of the new features that will be in the MarkLogic 5.0
		release, due out in a few months.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		My <a href="http://prezi.com/hfggzze5ad4j/mugl-august-2011-stephen-buxton/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>
		for this presentation gives a similar overview of MarkLogic
		as well as a few photos of Stephen.  Unfortunately, I didn't
		get a copy of Stephen's slides (and he probably wouldn't give
		them to me anyway).
	</p>

	<h2>July 14, 2011: Inaugural MUGL Meeting, John Snelson</h2>

	<p class="homepagetext">
		The very first meeting of the MUGL took place
		on July 14, 2011 at the Skills Matter Exchange.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		By all accounts it was a great success.  We had
		attendance of about 20 people, from a variety of
		companies around London that are using MarkLogic
		in many different ways.  Not bad considering we did
		very little promotion.  We even had a couple of
		senior MarkLogic people from The States drop by
		who were in London for other reasons.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		One of our members, Martin Dransfield, took some
		photos of the event.  Once I get the chance, I will
		upload them here and on the MeetUp site.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		My <a href="http://prezi.com/r-mzgxuw6fim/mugl-july-2011-john-snelson/" target="foo">MUGL intro presentation</a>,
		which gave a little background
		on the early days of MarkLogic,
		was apparently quite a hit.  It's Flash-based and
		done with a tool called Prezi.  You can play it
		in your very own browser from the Prezi site,
		just click the link above.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		Please spread the word about the MUGL to your
		friends and associates.  And don't forget to
		<a href="http://www.meetup.com/muglondon/" target="foo">sign up</a>
		if you plan to attend the next meeting.
