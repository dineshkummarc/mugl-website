		arkLogic User Group London is a newly formed organization for people
		that are users or fans of MarkLogic and those who are interested in
		learning more about MarkLogic, XML, XQuery and related technologies.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		While MarkLogic is where our common interest begins, the members
		of MUGL share many interests other than the "X" technologies (XML/XSL/XQuery)
		as well as web application design, publishing systems, search
		optimization and other content-centric disciplines.
	</p>
	<p class="homepagetext">
		All of our monthly meetings are free and open to the public.
		There is no formal membership requirement and all are welcome.
        To reserve a spot at the next meeting, visit the MeetUp link on
        the right side of this page.
