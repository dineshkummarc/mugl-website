		MarkLogic customers are quite numerous in and around London and
		those numbers are growing at a rapid rate.  Because so many users
		are concentrated in such a small geographic area the formation
		of a MarkLogic User Group is not only an obvious thing to do it's
		also long overdue.

	<p class="homepagetext">
		Every user of MarkLogic has a unique perspective and set of challenges.
		The goal of MUGL is to bring together people with common interests
		to learn, share and help each other in a friendly
		and supportive environment.  There will be plenty of hard-core
		nerdy tech talk, but it's also an opportunity to network and hang
		out with like-minded people that can understand the challenges you're
		facing on a daily basis.

		MUGL's founder, Ron Hitchens, is not only a MarkLogic user but also
		a former MarkLogic employee.
		Ron was a Lead Engineer on the Core Server Team at MarkLogic in California
		for five years.  Ron relocated to the UK in 2009 and is now an Ex-Pat
		American living in London building web services and
		publishing systems that harness the power of MarkLogic.
