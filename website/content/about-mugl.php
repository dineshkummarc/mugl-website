		MarkLogic customers are quite numerous in and around London and
		those numbers are growing at a rapid rate.  Because so many users
		are concentrated in such a small geographic area the formation
		of a MarkLogic User Group is not only an obvious thing to do it's
		long overdue.

	<p class="homepagetext">
		Every user of MarkLogic has a unique perspective set of challenges.
		The goal of MUGL is to bring people with common interests together
		to learn from each other, share with and help each other in a friendly
		and supportive environment.  There will be plenty of hard-code
		nerd tech talk, but it's also an opportunity to network and hang
		out with like-minded people that can understand the challenges you're
		facing on a daily basis.

		MUGL's founder, Ron Hitchens, is not only a MarkLogic user but also
		former employee and Lead Engineer on the Core Server Team at MarkLogic
		for five years.  Ron relocated to the UK in 2009 and is now an ex-pat
		American in London making a living building web services and
		publishing systems that exploit the power of MarkLogic.
